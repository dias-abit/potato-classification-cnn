# potato-classification-cnn

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for classifying different types of potatoes based on image data. The model is part of my final year thesis at **Nazarbayev University**, Robotics Engineering program.

The goal is to help automate agricultural product sorting by using computer vision and machine learning techniques.
